      <h1>Sun damage and your skin</h1>
      <article>
        <p>
          Sun damage to the skin is caused by exposure to ultraviolet (UV)
          radiation from the sun and tanning beds, leading to both immediate
          effects like sunburn and long-term issues such as premature aging and
          skin cancer. Long-term signs include wrinkles, age spots, loss of skin
          elasticity, uneven texture, and broken capillaries, while the damage
          can also cause precancerous lesions and increase the risk of melanoma
          and other skin cancers. Protecting your skin with sunscreen,
          protective clothing, and seeking shade is crucial for preventing sun
          damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          When sunlight hits your skin, it damages healthy cells. Without sun
          protection, this damage can build up. In time, you see signs of sun
          damage like freckles, age spots, and wrinkles. Some people develop
          precancerous skin growths, skin cancer, or both.

        <h2>What is photoaging?</h2>
        <p>
          Photoaging is the premature aging of your skin due to ongoing exposure
          to ultraviolet A (UVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation. Photodamage
          can come from natural UV radiation exposure from the sun or artificial
          UV light sources (tanning beds or sun lamps). UV exposure not only
          ages your skin more quickly than it naturally would, but can also
          increase your risk for skin cancer.

        <h2>
          What’s the difference between photoaging and chronological skin aging?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Chronological skin aging is the natural aging of your skin according
          to your age and your genetics. It’s not preventable. Photoaging is
          caused by a lifetime of UV radiation exposure, mostly from the sun.
          Photoaging causes DNA changes in the cells of your skin and can lead
          to cancer. If you take precautions, photoaging can be significantly
          reduced.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h2>Can sun damage be reversed?</h2>
        <p>
          Once UV radiation changes your skin cells’ DNA, the DNA damage can’t
          be reversed. However, this doesn’t mean that you can’t change the
          appearance of your skin. You can treat, reduce and/or repair the
          effects of sun-damaged skin. Treatments can remove spots and other
          skin discolorations, reduce wrinkles and fine lines, smooth out skin,
          stimulate new skin and collagen production — steps that improve the
          look, tone and quality of your skin.

        <h2>Who is at risk for skin damage from the sun?</h2>
        <p>
          Everyone is susceptible to sun-damaged skin. However, you’re more at
          risk for skin damage if you:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Have a light skin tone.</li>
          <li>
            Have had skin cancer or have a family history of skin cancer,
            especially melanoma.
          </li>
          <li>Have many moles.</li>
          <li>Have freckles and burn before tanning.</li>
          <li>
            Have blue or green colored eyes, or blond, red or light brown hair.
          </li>
          <li>
            Spend a lot of time outdoors and/or at tanning salons, especially as
            a child or teenager.
          </li>
