        <h1>About us:</h1>
        <p>
          Enjoying nature, gardening, going for a walk, breathing in the fresh
          air — all are great reasons to be outside. If you want to keep your
          skin in the best shape possible, you’ll want to apply 30+ SPF
          sunscreen every day to all exposed skin before stepping a foot outside
          your door — even on cloudy days or before getting into your car for a
          quick shop at the grocery store. UV radiation, especially from the
          sun, prematurely ages your skin. See your dermatologist if you’re
          concerned about the quality of your skin or notice any changes in your
          skin color or skin spots or lesions. Many treatments are available to
          repair sun-damaged skin and to easily treat skin cancers that are
          caught early.

        <h1>Prevention</h1>
        <h2>How can I prevent ultraviolet photoaging?</h2>
        <p>
          It’s typically hard to prevent photoaging completely. Photoaging is
          sun damage that collects over a lifetime of exposure. While it’s
          difficult — and not wise — to avoid sunlight entirely, you can still
          take steps to limit your exposure to UV radiation to reduce premature
          skin aging. Remember that lowering your risk of sun damage also lowers
          your risk of skin cancer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wear broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen every day. A
          broad-spectrum sunscreen protects your skin against both UVA and UVB
          rays. Use products with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 or higher.
          Reapply every two hours, sooner if you’re swimming or exercising. Keep
          in mind that exposure to UV radiation can happen while driving in your
          vehicle and outdoors on cloudy days. This is why you should apply
          sunscreen every day to all skin areas not covered by clothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wear a wide-brimmed hat, sunglasses with UV protection and lightweight
          long-sleeved shirts and pants while outside. Look for clothing with an
          ultraviolet protection factor label for extra protection.
        </p>
        <p>Avoid the peak UV hours, usually between 10:00 am and 4:00 pm.</p>

        <h2>
          Are there at-home treatments or over-the-counter remedies to treat
          premature skin aging?
        </h2>
        <p>
          There are hundreds of over-the-counter (OTC) treatments. Before trying
          any products, it’s important to get a basic understanding of the
          ingredients in skincare products that can improve the quality of your
          skin. Some of the ingredients you’ll discover include retinoids,
          antioxidants, peptides, alpha hydroxy acids, emollients and
          humectants.
